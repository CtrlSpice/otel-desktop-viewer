# Frontend checks

- `npm run lint` rejects both Oxlint errors and warnings. Keep the standard lint
  gate at zero warnings without disabling rules or adding blanket suppressions.
- `npm run lint:anti-slop:evaluate` reports the separate anti-slop cleanup backlog.
- After frontend changes, run `make build-ts` from the repository root and commit
  the updated `desktopexporter/internal/server/static` assets. `make test` runs
  the full local quality gate, including bundle freshness.
